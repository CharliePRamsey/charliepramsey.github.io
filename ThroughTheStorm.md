    <h3> Overview </h3>
    <p>Through the Storm is a VR experience that focuses on storytelling. The player rides a giant caterpillar, their friend, who is frightened by an ongoing storm. The player uses their tools to protect the caterpillar from the storm, learning various lessons along the way. A narrator guides the guest through the experience, stumbling in the story at parts to imply distress and improvisational storytelling. At the end, the guest learns that the story of the caterpillar was actually a bedtime story told by an older sibling to their younger sister in an effort to alleviate the stress of parents loudly fighting in the background.</p>

    <h3> My Contributions </h3>
    <p>I was one of two programmers on this assignment. I handled sundry programming tasks such as engineering the lightning effect, the fading system, and the wand's particle effect/functionality. Our team as a whole collaborated the general outline of the story, with our producer (Mollie Braley) doing the majority of actual script writing. We helped to edit and revise her script after it had been written, trying to hit the emotional beats in as believable a way as possible.</p>

    <h3> Challenges </h3>
    <p>Our goal was essentially to tell two stories at once, with the surface level Caterpillar story having a double meaning with regards to the true, familial story. We had to go through some revisions for the obstacles and dialogue in order to drive the connections home effectively. An example of an obstacle we designed to be symbolic was the dying flower. The flower fell apart, like the parents' relationship, but a new flower bloomed, symbolizing that there can still be beauty in the world unrelated to the current troubles. My team worked together to design these symbols and then put them in the game in a way that engaged the player. Using Trello helped keep everyone on track and updated with each others' progress.</p>
