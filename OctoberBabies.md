    <h3> Overview </h3>
    <p>October Babies is a Kinect infinite-runner game for 1 or 2 players. The player uses their arms and torso, flapping and leaning, to control a stork delivering babies during the most dangerous time of all: Halloween. This was a two-week project in which the assignment was to create something "fun". We chose the Kinect platform and held several brainstorming sessions to come up with a concept that utilized the Kinect's unique abilities. During the project, I contributed to the program development, production, and design of the game. It was a experience that helped teach the utility of playtesting, as we had to go through several revisions to get the scrolling landscape and flapping feeling just right.</p>

    <h3> My Contributions </h3>
    <p>I contributed to the production, design, and programmatic development of this game. While the art and soundtrack were out of my hands, I touched every other part of the pipeline from beginning to end. Some key features that I helped program or design are the scrolling landscape system, the bird's movement controls, and the global leaderboard using dreamlo.</p>

    <h3> 1 Player </h3>
    <p>The game can be played with either one or two players. When playing with one player, the stork is controlled by using the left and right arm to flap and the torso to lean left or right. Flapping allows the stork to gain altitude, then slowly descend downwards. Leaning allows the stork to move left or right. These movement options are in place to avoid the persistently spawning obstalces, in the form of common Halloween objects, and to collect the passing babies for delivery.</p>

    <h3> 2 Player </h3>
    <p>With two players, both players have control of only one wing. They stand side by side, each with one arm out. Naturally, the left player controls the left wing and the right controls the right. They have to lean together to turn. This was actually meant to be our sole method for control at the beginning of development, but upon playtesting and iteration we discovered that both this and single-player worked and were individually interesting.</p>
