    <h3> Overview </h3>
    <p>King of the Ring is a game made for the Entertainment Technology Center's Jam-O-Drum platform. The Jam-O-Drum is a table with four stations at the corners. Each player has a station, which has a wheel surrounding drum. In King of the Ring, players use their wheel to turn their character and their drum to propel themselves forward. The players' goals are twofold: to knock other players out of the ring and to collect special Championship belts. Performing either of these goals gets the player 1 point. There are two stages in the game, with the second round providing a completely different layout and way to play. Players also have 4 different character types to choose from for visual flair: Football player, Sumo wrestler, Luchadora, and Polar Bear Wearing a Judo Uniform.</p>

    <h3> My Contributions </h3>
    <p>I was a co-producer as well as a programmer on this assignment. I scheduled meetings, facilitated discussions, and generally made sure that everyone was on-task and updated with current information. As a programmer, I dabbled with almost every piece of the game. Some of my more substantial contributions are in handling Character movement/control as well as handling character death and scoring. UI was a lot of work because of constant revisions to the game design, meaning my fellow programmer and I collaborated often to update it. Much of the programming on King of the Ring was done in pair programming style, so that each of us could better think through and understand the problems and solutions.</p>

    <h3> Iteration </h3>
    <p>King of the Ring, being such a simple game, demanded perfection in game feel. To that end, my team and I did a lot of playtesting and iteration. We would often tweak major or minor things, maybe creating several variations of a solution, and then playtest our changes to see what players liked and didn't like. One major example of this is in the basic mechanic of King of the Ring. Originally, players would move their characters in a manner similar to golfing games. They hit the drum once to begin gaining power, then hit again to propel themselves with the desired amount of power. This turned out to be too slow and methodical for our tastes. To alleviate that, we created three new versions of the gameplay and tried each one with playtesters before landing on a path forward.</p>
