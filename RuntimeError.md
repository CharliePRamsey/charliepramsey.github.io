    <h3> Overview </h3>
    <p>A Meta 2 experience in which the guest uses their hands to form bridges and swat away enemies so that a friendly AI companion can save the computer from permanent corruption. This was our first Round of Building Virtual Worlds. We were given two weeks to create the experience. That necessitated that we quickly brainstorm, prototype, and collaborate to create this unique product.</p>

    <h3> My Contributions </h3>
    <p>I contributed to the design and programming work that was done on this experience. This was a brand new piece of technology to me, not to mention a brand new medium in AR. I quickly had to learn how to utilize the tech to craft an engaging, interactive experience.</p>

    <h3> Iteration </h3>
    <p>After our Interim presentation, one week into the project, we came away with several key points that we wanted to iterate on. Firstly, and most importantly, our story was not clear to the guest. We alleviated this issue by adding some voice lines here and there, as well as forcing the guest to come in close to the AI character at the beginning. This both increased engagement and created an immediate connection between the guest and character. To the right is a video link to our Interim version, while above is a link to the final version.</p>
