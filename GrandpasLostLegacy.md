       <p align="left">This assignment was to create an experience that is "naive-guest" friendly. That is to say, as accessible as possible. </p>

    <h3> Overview </h3>
    <p>Grandpa's Lost Legacy was an experience designed with naive guests in mind. My team and I crafted it with the hope that we could both tell a story of old, unsolved mysteries and ancient ruins while also preventing new players from becoming too stuck or confused at any point. To this end, we had a firefly particle system, the brightest moving object in the scene, that would constantly be flying from the tip of the player's staff to their next objective. The player's main goal was to trace patterns on the stones, which are all relatively simple. Some curveballs thrown include spider-webs blocking the stone or the stone needing to be rotated using the player's hand.</p>

    <h3> My Contributions </h3>
    <p>I was both producer and programmer for this project. I scheduled and helped mediate our discussions. I made sure to solicit the opinions and ideas of all present so that we could make the best possible product. On the programming side, I handled many varied tasks. I created the firefly particle system and wrote the script that guided them from one stone to another. I also handled the general sequence of events for the game, going from the map to ruins to floating rocks to study, and the required steps to achieve them therein. I put the webbing in the world and used Unity's cloth system to make them appear more sticky and interactable. My fellow programmer helped out with some of these tasks, but was primarily responsible for writing the pattern-tracing mechanic.</p>

    <h3> Challenges </h3>
    <p>Most of our challenge came from our feedback or indirect control not being strong or intuitive enough. For example, people would often try to sweep away the webs, but it originally took too long to clear them and would leave guests confused and frustrated. The rotating stone near the end originally did not have a handprint on the back, which left guests perplexed as to what to do with it and why this particular stone had no pattern to trace. We did our best to rectify these problems and other smaller issues like them by playtesting with a variety of naive guests. We briefly interviewed them afterwards, taking notes on their feedback and performance to allow us to make more informed design decisions.</p>
